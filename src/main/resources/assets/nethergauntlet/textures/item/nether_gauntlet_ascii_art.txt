Color Guide:
- # = Dark gray/black (base metal of the gauntlet)
- X = Dark red with orange/yellow highlights (glowing parts)
- Empty space = Transparent

The gauntlet should have a dark metal base with glowing red/orange accents that look like they're pulsing with the power of the Nether.

Remember to save the actual texture as a 16x16 pixel PNG file named "nether_gauntlet.png" in this directory.
