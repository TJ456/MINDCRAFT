PLACEHOLDER FOR NETHER GAUNTLET TEXTURE

This file is a placeholder for the actual nether_gauntlet.png texture.

To create the actual texture:
1. Create a 16x16 pixel PNG image
2. Design it following the guidelines in nether_gauntlet.txt
3. Save it as "nether_gauntlet.png" in this directory
4. Delete this placeholder file

The texture should look like a powerful gauntlet with Nether-themed elements.
