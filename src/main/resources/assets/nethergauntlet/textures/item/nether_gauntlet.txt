Nether Gauntlet Texture Guide
===========================

This file provides guidance for creating the Nether Gauntlet texture.

Texture Requirements:
- Size: 16x16 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Color scheme: Reds, oranges, and dark grays to match Nether theme

Design Suggestions:
- Base: Dark gray/black metal appearance
- Accents: Glowing orange/red lines to represent lava/fire energy
- Knuckles: Could have small spikes or magma-like protrusions
- Palm area: Consider adding a small magma/fire symbol

The texture should look like a powerful gauntlet that harnesses the power of the Nether.
When worn, it should appear on the player's hand when viewed in first-person mode.

Save your completed texture as "nether_gauntlet.png" in this same directory.
